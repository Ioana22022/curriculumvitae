\section{Work Experience}
\cventry{Sep, 2019 – Present}{Software Engineer - System Health Team}{Harman}{
	Continued on the same project built for an embedded Linux platform, and first started on the Performance Domain. Started with analysis of tickets regarding bugs and poor performance, detect root cause, provide solution, and implementation. Contributed to development and improvement of several features, including the process of fetching information from systemd-journal with sd\_journal API, collecting tmpfs information, implementation from scratch of a decoder tool requested by architects to ease bug analysis. Continuing to provide support on most tickets arriving in SH team, as having expertise in four different domains for the current project.
Languages: \textbf{C/C++}, \textbf{Bash}, \textbf{Java} (when explicitly needed)
Tools used: \textbf{GDB}, \textbf{lttng/Trace Compass}, \textbf{Yocto}, \textbf{DLT-Viewer}, \textbf{GitHub}, \textbf{SVN}, \textbf{Jira}, \textbf{Crucible}, \textbf{Atlassian Confluence}}{}{}
\cventry{Sep, 2018 – Aug, 2019}{Software Engineer - System Lifecycle Team}{Harman}{
	System Lifecycle Team dealt with the application which was responsible with the boot-up and shutdown of the system, having a number of reported bugs exponentially growing upon my arrival. Contributed to bug fixing, development of features for the Engineering Menu on the infotainment system, also to systemd dependencies configuration.}{}{}
\cventry{Oct, 2017 – March, 2018}{Concept Engineering}{Infineon Technologies, Romania}{ As part of the concept engineering team, main responsabilities included development of python scripts for processing data regarding pressure and magnetic sensors models. Languages: Python/Pandas module, Bash. Tools: PyCharm, Matlab/Simulink}{}{}
\cventry{June, 2017 – September, 2017}{Summer Internship at ADAS Department, Algorithm Development (C++)}{Continental Automotive, Romania}{Contributed to implementation of the Pothole and Speedbump Detector, worked on features/bug fixes such as: reducing the number false positive outcomes, keeping track of SB's detected}{}{}

\section{Projects}

\cvline{MPTCP-aware HTTP Load Balancer}{My task was to implement an \textbf{MPTCP}-aware \textbf{HTTP} load-balancer using \textbf{OpenFlow}. The experimental setup consisted of installing an mptcp-capable kernel, configuring path-manager and install a \textbf{Mininet} VM to simulate a network consisting of three hosts and an OpenFlow switch. When the client initiated connections, the controller hashed the IP addresses and ports and use the hash to pick one of the two servers. The controller also examines the SYN+ACK messages and learn the server's key in order to create the servers token, so when the client creates the new subflow, it examines the token and send the subflow to the appropiate server.}
\cvline{Embedded System based on Versatile Platform Baseboard}{Built using \textbf{Yocto} and emulated with \textbf{QEMU}. Had a basic image consisting of : kernel Image already compiled, layer with rpi basic image recipe and other layers. The system consisted of the following features: able to send and receive data over predefined format, had user root with defined password, configured it’s own IP using \textbf{DHCP}, able to respond on \textbf{SSH} on a configured port to <some name>.local Avahi/DNS daemon, could communicate through tty/AMA0 serial interface (this was configured on the QEMU command), had a Web interface where it could plot the history data and also send data through it (plotly.js). Receiving and sending data were developed with python scripts, that were later added on the system’s 2nd  run level through an additional Yocto recipe.
}
\cvline{Designing CPU (8086) in Verilog}{One of the most challenging coursework was to design a basic CPU that could support instructions such as ADD, SUB, MOV, POP, PUSH, JMP, AND, OR, XOR, conditioned JMP and others. Sketch code was provided from laboratory.}
\cvline{Million Song Dataset}{Inspected a selected subset of the Million Song DataSet of 10000 songs using \textbf{Spark} framework and implemented three tasks: Exposing the loudness war trend, with a map-reduce algorithm and plotted the evolution using \textbf{Gnuplot}. Quantified the tendencies for crossover between genres. Result was a crossover matrix, where cell(x, y) denoted how much of a crossover there is between genre x and genre y.}{}{}{}{}
